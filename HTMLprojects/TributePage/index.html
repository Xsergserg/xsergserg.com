					Ragnar Lodbrok or Lothbrok (Old Norse: Ragnarr Loðbrók, "Ragnar shaggy
					breeches", contemporary Norse: Ragnar Loðbrók) was a historically
					dubious[1][2] Norse Viking hero and legendary king of Denmark and
					Sweden, known from Viking Age Old Norse poetry and sagas. According to
					that traditional literature, Ragnar distinguished himself by many
					raids against Francia and Anglo-Saxon England during the 9th century.
					There is no evidence that he existed under this name and outside of
					the mythology associated with him. According to the Tale of Ragnar
					Lodbrok, Ragnar was the son of the Swedish king Sigurd Ring.

					According to the Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok, Ragnar was the son of the
					Swedish king Sigurd Ring. The Hervarar saga tells that when Valdar
					died, his son Randver became the king of Sweden, while Harald Wartooth
					became the king of Denmark. Then Harald conquered all of his
					grandfather Ivar Vidfamne's territory. After Randver's death, his son
					Sigurd Hring became the king of Sweden, presumably as the subking of
					Harald. Sigurd Hring and Harald fought the Battle of the Brávellir
					(Bråvalla) on the plains of Östergötland, where Harald and many of his
					men died. Sigurd ruled Sweden and Denmark from about 770 until his
					death in about 804. He was succeeded by his son Ragnar Lodbrok. Harald
					Wartooth's son Eysteinn Beli ruled Sweden as Ragnar's viceroy until he
					was killed by the sons of Ragnar. The Tale of Ragnar's Sons tells that
					the Great Heathen Army that invaded England in 865 was led by the sons
					of Ragnar Lodbrok, to wreak revenge against King Ælla of Northumbria
					who had supposedly captured and executed Ragnar.

					The Great Heathen Army is said to have been led by the sons of Ragnar
					Lodbrok, to wreak revenge against King Ælla of Northumbria who had
					supposedly executed Ragnar in 865 by casting him into a pit full of
					snakes.[8] The Great Heathen Army was organized and led by the
					brothers Ivar the Boneless, Ubba, Halfdan, Björn Ironside, Hvitserk,
					and Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye. The first four are known historical
					figures.[9] Ivar the Boneless was the leader of the Great Heathen Army
					from 865 to 870, but he disappears from English historical accounts
					after 870.[10] The Anglo-Saxon chronicler Æthelweard records Ivar's
					death as 870.[11] Halfdan Ragnarsson became the leader of the Great
					Heathen Army in about 870 and he led it in an invasion of Wessex.[12]
					A great number of Viking warriors arrived from Scandinavia, as part of
					the Great Summer Army, led by King Bagsecg of Denmark, bolstering the
					ranks of Halfdan's army.[13]
				</p>
				<p>
					to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the Danes battled the West Saxons nine
					times, including the Battle of Ashdown on 8 January 871, where Bagsecg
					was killed.[14] Halfdan accepted a truce from the future Alfred the
					Great, newly crowned king of Wessex.[15] Halfdan succeeded Bagsecg as
					King of most of Denmark (Jutland and Wendland) in about 871. Bjorn
					Ironside became King of Sweden and Uppsala in about 865, (the same
					year his father Ragnar is said to have died). Bjorn had two sons,
					Refil and Erik Björnsson. His son Erik became the next king of Sweden,
					and was succeeded in turn by Erik the son of Refil. Sigurd
					Snake-in-the-eye became King of Zealand and the Danish Isles in about
					871, and also succeeded his brother Halfdan as King of Denmark in
					about 877.
